# 👨‍💻C-Programming Learner's Repository!👨‍💻

👋🏻 Welcome to the C Programming Learner's Repository!

👉This repository contains a collection of C programming exercises, examples, and projects to help you get started with learning C.

Here's what you'll find in this repository:👇

📑Exercises: These are small programming problems designed to help you practice and improve your C skills.

📌Examples: These are complete C programs that demonstrate how to use various features of the language.

📓Projects: These are larger programming projects that put your skills to the test.

🤔What do you need to get started?
Answer: To get started, you'll need a C compiler. If you don't already have one installed, you can download and install one for free from the internet.

Check below for C Compiler installation guide suited to an operating system of your choice 👇: 

-To learn how to install a C compiler on Windows: https://linuxhint.com/install-c-compiler-windows/

-To learn to install GCC Compiler for Ubuntu (linux distro): https://data-flair.training/blogs/install-c-on-linux/

-To install GCC compiler on MacOS: https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/106465


Once you have a C compiler installed, you can compile and run a C program by using the following steps:

Open a terminal window.
Navigate to the directory where your C program is saved.
Type gcc followed by the name of your C program file, and then press Enter. For example: gcc main.c
If the program compiles without errors, it will create an executable file.
To run the program, type ./a.out and press Enter.
We hope you find these resources helpful as you begin your journey to learn C programming. Good luck!

Otherway is to download any code-editor according to convenience.
Our recommendation is to download and install Microsoft's Visual Studio Code and further install some suitable program extensions.
